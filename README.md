### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, My name is Dj Litts. As of October 2023, I am a graduate of Tech Elevator coding bootcamp. 
My biggest project on here is my SuperFan Source website, which is my final capstone project from Tech Elevator.

Keep an eye out for upcoming projects from me regarding a Baccarat Simulator, and a Sudoku Solver.
